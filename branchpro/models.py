class ForwardModel(object):
    """ForwardModel Class:
    Base class for the model classes included in the branchpro package.
    Classes inheriting from ``ForwardModel`` class can implement the methods
    directly in Python.

    Methods
    -------
    simulate: return model output for specified parameters and times.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        super(ForwardModel, self).__init__()

    def simulate(self, parameters, times):
        """
        Runs a forward simulation with the given ``parameters`` and returns a
        time-series with data points corresponding to the given ``times``.

        Returns a sequence of length ``n_times`` (for single output problems)
        or a NumPy array of shape ``(n_times, n_outputs)`` (for multi-output
        problems), representing the values of the model at the given ``times``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        parameters
            An ordered sequence of parameter values.
        times
            The times at which to evaluate. Must be an ordered sequence,
            without duplicates, and without negative values.
            All simulations are started at time 0, regardless of whether this
            value appears in ``times``.
